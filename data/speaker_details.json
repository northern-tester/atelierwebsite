			"title": "Organic Quality, it starts with the soil",
			"abstract": "Throughout my career from Tester and Quality Coach to Engineering Manager. I have relied on an approach Organic Quality. This philosophy has consistently helped the teams I work with mature and achieve high performance fast. At its core, Organic Quality is built upon three key values: kindness, curiosity, and credibility. By embracing these values, individuals and teams can create an environment where success feels effortless and work becomes something to genuinely enjoy. Sounds easy right? We all know that when people are involved, things are never easy! In this talk I will walk through the four pillars of Organic Quality: Conscious Awareness, Open Communication, Social Responsibility & Empowered Leadership.  There will be real life stories of our learnings and actionable examples of how everyone can be a little more organic at work.",
			"bio": "I live in West Yorkshire and have been working as an Engineering Manager with my background being in Quality Coaching. I love putting people first, and that is exactly why I stated The Organic Edge Newsletter and started to document Organic Quality. My approach has helped scale engineering teams across the globe ranging from unicorn start-ups to FTSE 250 companies. I have always been curious about how the world works and I am a passionate supporter of changing the narrative around dyslexia."

			"title": "AI Agents - Lets Talk...",
			"abstract": "Let's talk about the latest hot topic in our industry - AI Agents. They might be coming for your job, entire workforces may be replaced by these super-smart chunks of code, so what does it mean for you? We'll also see one in action.",
			"bio": "Andy is by day a Principal Platform Engineer at a gambling firm, by night an opensource AI contributor working with LLMs and AI applications running in Kubernetes. Currently working with K8sGPT to help analyse and diagnose faults on Kubernetes clusters. He also is a small part of the organizing team for DevOpsDays London and ran the DevOps meetup in Leeds for almost a decade hosting over 50 events. He’s attended and has spoken at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his own words is \"an all-round DevOps nuisance\"."

			"title": "Testing your assumptions - You are not your customer",
			"abstract": "This talk goes over some of the assumptions development teams can make and how recognising them can help teams build better quality products - because you are not your customer.",
			"bio": "Emily O'Connor is a Principal Test Engineer at Audacia, a consultancy that work across a variety of industries. Given each consultant cannot be an expert in each of them - Emily uses this to her advantage by identifying edge cases and test scenarios by recognising the fact that she is not often the companies typical users."

			"title": "Stoicism & Software Testing: Ancient Philosophy Meets Modern Methods",
			"abstract": "Testing is often chaos, uncertainty, changing requirements, constant defects, and a challenging stakeholder. What is the answer to this chaos? A 2000-year-old philosophy?? Stephen's talk will about Stoicism and how it's principles can be used to gain a different perspective on this chaos to make us happier testers.",
			"bio": "Stephen is an award winning (European Software Testing awards, TESTA) tester and QA, with a passion for test improvement and development. I have worked in most aspects of electronic engineering/software engineering. He has a passion for testing and understanding complex applications, technologies, and projects. To quote him, \"I want to be the best manager, tester, and coach I can be, to be \"The Stoic Tester\""

			"title": "Testing in the dark: Life as a research software engineer",
			"abstract": "This short talk will give the audience an insight into the chaotic underworld that is research software engineering. It aims to ignite inter-contextual learning in areas like software design, testing, and supporting neurodiversity in teams. If you've ever been curious about engineering in an academic research context, this one's for you!",
			"bio": "Having bounced around academia and the tech industry in various roles, Sorrel now works part-time as a research software engineer at Leeds University and part-time as a freelance learning coach and consultant to engineering teams. Much of what we do as engineers hinges on our capacity to learn, independently and collaboratively, yet learning to learn isn't a prominent feature of most curriculums. That's why she started her consultancy, where she can bring her research and teacher experience to support continuous learning."

			"abstract": "Ever wondered how you might reduce the number of UI tests you have and still cover the key scenarios? Costa will answer the question what the heck is subcutaneous testing? With loads of real examples of how Pactumjs makes this easy! ",
			"bio": "I’m a tester and I absolutely love it. It’s what I was meant to do even though it’s something I fell into by luck. I have worked at MadeByPi, Sky, DAZN, Infinity Works/Accenture and now Collibra. I see myself as a quality engineer and quality coach as testing is everyone’s responsibility. My goal is to shepherd the team I am in and point them in the right direction of creating high quality software. I am a father of 3 amazing daughters. I also love playing 5 a side football and snooker."

			"title": "AI Ethics in SDLC",
			"abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse domains such as healthcare, transportation, and consumer services has transformed societal and technological landscapes. However, this rapid adoption also amplifies the ethical challenges posed by AI systems, including issues related to bias, privacy, transparency, and accountability. Addressing these challenges requires adoption of AI ethics throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) while fostering collaboration across diverse functional teams, including developers, designers, testers, and end-users.",
			"bio": "My name is Olawale Ibitoye, and I am a tester with six years of testing experience. I also hold a master's degree in AI and data science. I enjoy discussing technology and ethics, and in my free time, I am an avid fan of sports, particularly football."

			"name": "Kat Obring",
			"picture": "images/speakers/kat_obring.jpeg",
			"title": "From Gatekeepers to Coaches: Evolving the QA Role in Agile Teams",
			"abstract": "Every agile team I ever worked on has at one time or another felt held back by their QA process, and often rightly so, because too many QAs have been trained to be gatekeepers, not enablers of safe releases. In this talk, you’ll hear how modern QA professionals can shift from being that bottleneck into quality coaches, finally breaking down silos and building stronger engineering culture. I’ll present practical strategies for implementing this shift, such as pair testing, collaborative code reviews and quality-focused workshops that will improve the entire team’s testing capabilities.",
			"bio": "After 20 successful years in the software industry, I now teach teams and individuals shift-left testing strategies and leveraging DevOps practices to achieve speedy delivery with predictable quality. My tenure at companies such as Linden Lab (Second Life), Disney Online, Infinity Works, and Accenture has reinforced my belief that most technology challenges are fundamentally about people. Therefore, my focus is on developing processes and nurturing relationships that foster high-performing, contented teams. I emphasise that effective testing is a critical component of quality engineering that will speed up your delivery, not slow it down."

			"name": "Chris Briggs",

			"title": "The Good, The Right, and The Fitting: Moral Philosophy in Software Testing",
			"abstract": "The future is now. Never before have we had such power to do harm—or to do good. But what is good? What is right? What is fitting—and for whom? Can we afford the luxury of thinking about morality in software testing? Can we afford not to? Quality Engineering often focuses on functional and non-functional attributes, ensuring performance, security, and usability. Even the broader, glue-work role of QEs tends to center on fulfilling business needs and meeting delivery goals. Yet, whether we acknowledge it or not, our work has an inherent moral dimension. This talk begins with an exploration of Aristotelian, Kantian, and Utilitarian ethics, introducing core philosophical concepts that we will then apply to real-world software testing dilemmas. The purpose of this talk is not to leave attendees with answers or definitive frameworks. Instead, attendees will leave with a conceptual scaffolding that enables them to critically examine their own domains, collaboratively assess ethical challenges, integrate moral reasoning into their decision-making, and hopefully, a lot of questions! Ethical testing isn’t only about avoiding harm in the present - but about doing good, now and in the future.",
			"bio": "I fell into testing eight years and have loved the work ever since. I’ve been on a number of professional journeys; from manual to a hybrid of auto-manual testing, bare functional testing to considering all quality attributes, being a team member, to being a leader, and attending community events and conferences to now, speaking at them. With a lively and at times, derailing interest in the world I love to play with ideas and new perspectives. Otherwise I do enjoy a spot of cooking and crafting."
