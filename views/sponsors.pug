				|The Atelier is hosted at The Tetley, Leeds, a former brewery HQ turned awesome event space. Previously hosted at Wharf Chambers, we could originally only host 100 attendees, but our new venue for 2025 will allow us to invite over 150 attendees. We are keen to provide a safe space for all involved in testing, however they choose to express themselves.
				
			p
				|Here at the Atelier we value speaker diversity, therefore we encourage people from different backgrounds speaking, this covers gender, ethnicity and job role. The event has a variety of talks, workshops and panels.  Some of the past topics that our talks have covered are; a DBA talking about database unit testing, a tester talking about mobile automation, a recruiter on how to hire great testers, a developer teaching TDD, a build engineer on DevOps adoption, the list goes on. The Atelier is volunteer run and is a day with punk rock vibes by the community for the community.
