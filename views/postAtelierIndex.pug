			h3 On the 13th of May 2025, the fully independent, punk, Leeds Testing Atelier roared to life again, filling The Tetley with attendees, speakers, sponsors and organisers. Loads of laughter, learning and collaboration ensued! We hope you had fun, the feedback is in and we've got a few things to tweak and some big, serious grown up conversations to have!
